# COMP2132 Assignment 1

For this assignment, you must create an external script named index.js and link it in the head of the provided .html file to test your code

The index.js file must do the following:
  - Insert your preferred name and student id into the .innerHTML of the h1 element with id "a1"

NOTE: you should not be modifying any markup in the body of the page. I will be testing your script against my own copy of this .html file â€“ changing ids, tag names or other attributes may cause your script to run incorrectly and result in lost marks.
